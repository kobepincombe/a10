    The API used above is PokéAPI and I found it on the class-featured GitHub
    repository at https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis. The specific
    website that contains the API is https://pokeapi.co/. The options I used
    for the API request were the ID or name of a Pokémon as an input to get the
    front shiny sprite as well as the name in proper form. This was a use that
    I thought was simple and fun, but the API as a whole has a lot more practical
    functionality and information. This API has the information for the moves,
    abilities, experience rate, held items, and much more for every Pokémon in
    the games. Thus, I can easily think of two applications where this API would
    be helpful. The first is in competitive play when looking to build a viable
    team while considering the move-sets of Pokémon as well as its stats. A second
    application of this API is shiny hunting, as the API has the location data
    and shiny sprite data of each Pokémon.
